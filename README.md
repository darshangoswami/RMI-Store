# Digital Marketplace System

The Digital Marketplace System is a sophisticated platform designed to facilitate online commerce, connecting buyers and sellers in a seamless and efficient digital environment. Built upon Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) technology, this system exemplifies the power and flexibility of distributed object-oriented programming, enabling remote interactions between various components of the application as if they were local to each other.

The system comprises different components to facilitate seamless interaction between users and administrators. Users can browse available products, add items to their shopping cart, and make purchases, while administrators have additional privileges such as updating item details, managing inventory, and handling user accounts.
